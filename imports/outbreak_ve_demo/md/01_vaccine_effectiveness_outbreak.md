# Estimating Vaccine Effectiveness in an Outbreak

An outbreak of **measles**, a highly contagious viral disease, occurred in a semi-urban community with mixed vaccination coverage. Measles is one of the most transmissible infectious diseases, with a basic reproduction number (R₀) often estimated between 12 and 18.

Public health teams initiated an outbreak investigation to:

- identify confirmed and suspected cases

- determine vaccination status

- assess transmission patterns

- estimate the **real-world effectiveness of the vaccine**

For an overview of measles epidemiology, see:\

## Understanding Vaccine Effectiveness

Vaccine effectiveness (VE) refers to how well a vaccine performs in real-world conditions, outside controlled clinical trials.

Unlike vaccine efficacy, effectiveness reflects:

- population diversity

- variation in exposure

- real-world healthcare access

- behavioural factors

## Why This Matters in Public Health

Estimating vaccine effectiveness is essential for:

- evaluating vaccination programmes

- identifying vulnerable populations

- informing outbreak response

- guiding policy decisions

##  Key Concept

Callout :: important

Text :: Vaccine effectiveness measures the reduction in disease risk among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in real-world conditions.

## Observed Data

The following table summarises the number of cases and non-cases among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals during the outbreak.

  --------------------------------------------------------
  **Group**      **Cases (a, c)**   **Non-cases (b, d)**
  -------------- ------------------ ----------------------
  Vaccinated     4                  96

  Unvaccinated   20                 80
  --------------------------------------------------------

## Formula for Vaccine Effectiveness

Vaccine effectiveness is calculated as:

VE = (1 − Relative Risk) × 100

## Step-by-Step Calculation

Reveal\
Step 1 :: Calculate risk in the vaccinated group: 5 / 500 = 0.01\
Step 2 :: Calculate risk in the unvaccinated group: 25 / 500 = 0.05\
Step 3 :: Relative Risk = 0.01 / 0.05 = 0.2\
Step 4 :: VE = (1 − 0.2) × 100 = 80%

## Pause and Reflect

SelfCheck\
Question :: Why might vaccine effectiveness differ between populations?\
Answer :: Differences in exposure, population structure, healthcare access, and underlying health conditions can influence estimates.

## Visualising the Results

R Code\
group \<- c(\"Vaccinated\", \"Unvaccinated\")\
cases \<- c(5, 25)\
population \<- c(500, 500)

risk \<- cases / population

barplot(risk, names.arg = group, col = c(\"steelblue\", \"tomato\"),\
main = \"Risk of Infection by Vaccination Status\")

## Interpreting the Results

Tabs\
Interpretation :: An 80% vaccine effectiveness means vaccinated individuals have substantially lower risk compared to unvaccinated individuals.\
Assumptions :: The calculation assumes both groups are comparable and equally exposed.\
Limitations :: Confounding factors such as age, immunity, or healthcare access may influence results.

## Quiz

Question :: Based on the outbreak data, what does a vaccine effectiveness of 80% mean in practice?

Option :: Vaccinated individuals have zero risk of infection

Option :: Vaccinated individuals have an 80% lower risk of infection than unvaccinated individuals

Option :: 80% of vaccinated individuals will not become infected

Option :: The vaccine prevents 80 cases in every outbreak regardless of context

Answer :: Vaccinated individuals have an 80% lower risk of infection than unvaccinated individuals

Explanation :: Vaccine effectiveness compares the risk of disease in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups under real-world conditions. An 80% VE means the vaccinated group experienced substantially lower risk, not that infection risk was eliminated entirely.

## 

## Key Takeaway

Callout :: tip\
Text :: Vaccination significantly reduces the likelihood of infection and severe disease, even if it does not eliminate risk entirely.
